[Jeedom](https://jeedom.com) plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)

### What this plugin does
This plugin allows you to run Jeedom commands via HomeKit. This means you can run a Jeedom commands just by telling Siri to do so. An example usage for this plugin would be to turn ON one Jeedom object, check if itâ€™s on, and even shut it down when finished.

### How this plugin works
- `on_cmd`: This is the command executed when the switch is turned ON.
- `off_cmd`: This is the command executed when the switch is turned OFF.
- `state_cmd`: This is the command executed when Homebridge checks the state of the switch.

### Things to know about this plugin
This plugin can only run Jeedom commands. In order to test if your `on_cmd`, `off_cmd`, or `state_cmd` are valid commands you need to run them from your CLI. Please keep in mind you will want to run these commands from the same user that runs (or owns) the Homebridge service if different than your root user.
